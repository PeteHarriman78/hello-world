# hello-world
\\ My name is Peter Harriman. I am 37 years old.
\\ I have 5 wonderful children.
\\ I have been a carpenter for 22 years.
\\ I went back to school in 2006 to become a Software Engineer.
\\ I could not afford to finish school, so I continued working as a Carpenter to support my family.
\\ I was diagnosed with severe carpel tunnel syndrome last year, and can no longer perform my duties as a Carpenter.
\\ I am here to further my knowledge and hopefully begin my career as a developer.
