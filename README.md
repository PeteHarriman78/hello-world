# hello-world
My name is Peter Harriman. I am 37 years old.
I have 5 wonderful children.
I have been a carpenter for 22 years.
I went back to school in 2006 to become a Software Engineer.
I could not afford to finish school, so I continued working as a Carpenter to support my family.
I was diagnosed with severe carpel tunnel syndrome last year, and can no longer perform my duties as a Carpenter.
I am here to further my knowledge and hopefully begin my career as a developer.
